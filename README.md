**zVision is trained yolo package for zebrafish research**

Currently, we are open-sourcing three vision models:

1. zVision-widecam: A wide-angle camera/webcam model designed for top-view segmentation and tracking of 5–10 dpf larvae.
2. zVision-stereom: Optimized for analyzing 5–10 dpf fish under a stereomicroscope.
3. zVision-adultsys: Enables keypoint tracking for adult fish in tanks or standalone systems.
